kalaha-frontend

As part of a technical assignment for an interview I was tasked with creating a web based Kalaha game.

I took a REST API and javascript frontend approach.

Unfortunately I did not make it through the interview process, but have decided to keep this project
as a way to learn and practice my skills for the next interview.

If you would like to practice as well , or have any useful tips for improvements then please fork this code or
create an issue with a suggestion.

Much appreciated
